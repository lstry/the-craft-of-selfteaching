D-Side - Fly

For so long
You've been holding on
Smiling all the way
I can't believe you're gone

In your eyes
We saw the strength to fight
The ever fading light
Now the memories
Ease our pain and set you free

Fly. Fly away
And when you arrive
remember my name

Goodbye perfect days
Now I am left with words
I'll never get to say
Fly away

In my dreams
I feel your presence near
We laugh a million laughs
And cry as many tears

On the road
to a future made of gold
And someone takes your hand
And leads you to a place I can't go
So Fly, Fly away
And when you arrive
remember my name

Goodbye perfect days
Now I am left with words
I'll never get to say
So fly away.

Now I know I'll touch your face again
And see those eyes of blue
You'll u run your fingers through my hair
Like no one else can do
There's no one like you
Until we meet again
I am always missing you
I am crying out
crying out
As you fly.
Fly away
And when you arrive,
remember my name

There's tears on my face
Now I am left with words that
I never get to say

Fly. Fly away
And when you arrive
remember my name

Goodbye perfect days
Now I am left with words
I'll never get to say
So fly away.
Fly fly Fly away
Fly fly Fly away
